                    Hi there! I'm Noor Mostafa, an ambitious and versatile student with a passion for leveraging data and technology 
                    to drive meaningful change. With a strong foundation in Information Systems and Computer Science  from 
                    Carnegie Mellon University, I've honed my skills in various areas, including software development, data analysis, and
                    project management.
                </p>

                    During my internship at Amicus Therapeutics, I developed datapipelines to streamline technical operations and 
                    enhance business planning. At AdSkate, an ad-tech startup, I  made a significant impact in improving sales and machine learning models
                    by building a data collection application with web scraping APIs. Additionally, my experience as a Research 
                    Assistant at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute allowed me to apply my Python expertise to optimize school bus routes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What sets me apart is my ability to blend technical expertise with a strong focus on social impact. I thrive in leadership roles and 
                    have demonstrated this as the Director of Students Using Data for Social Good. I successfully grew the organization, managed finances, 
                    and spearheaded data science projects solving real-world problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am passioante about building software products from the ground up, and am well versed in Python, C, 
                    SQL, and application and database development.
                </p>
